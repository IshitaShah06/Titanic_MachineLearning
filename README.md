# Titanic_MachineLearning
Machine Learning ALgorithms on Titanic Dataset, Cleaning and imputing the dataset with null values and missing values. Finally testing the hypothesis and accuracy of the Dataset using various models/ALgorithms like KNN, Gausian, SVM.  ANalysing who all survived and what all factors mattered for survival at the time of the unfortunate Tragedy.
